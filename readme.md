# Zendesk Exporter

## Description
This project connects to the Zendesk API to retrieve tickets (and their comments), then exports the data to a CSV file. It:
- Uses environment variables instead of hard-coding credentials (for security)
- Handles pagination to fetch tickets in batches
- Fetches additional comments for each ticket, beyond the initial description
- Saves the final data to a timestamped CSV file

## How to Download This Code
There are two main ways to download the code from this repository: **`zendesk_exporter_project`** under the GitHub user **`rodbland2021`**.

### 1. Download as a ZIP File (No Git Required)
1. Open this repository on GitHub:  
   [https://github.com/rodbland2021/zendesk_exporter_project](https://github.com/rodbland2021/zendesk_exporter_project)
2. Click the green **"Code"** button near the top-right
3. Select **"Download ZIP"**
4. Unzip the downloaded file on your computer, and you will have all the files from this repository

*This method is simplest if you just want a one-time copy without needing Git or version control.*

### 2. Clone with Git
If you want the full Git history (to pull future updates or contribute back), clone the repository using Git.

#### Option A: Git Command Line
1. Install Git (if you haven't already)
2. Open a terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Git Bash)
3. Navigate to the folder where you want the repository stored. For example:
   ```bash
   cd C:\path\to\your\folder
   ```
4. Run:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rodbland2021/zendesk_exporter_project.git
   ```
This creates a new folder named `zendesk_exporter_project` containing all the files, commit history, and branches.

#### Option B: GitHub Desktop
1. Install GitHub Desktop from [desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com)
2. Open GitHub Desktop and sign in to your GitHub account
3. Go to **File â†’ Clone repository**
4. Under the **URL** tab, enter:
   ```
   https://github.com/rodbland2021/zendesk_exporter_project.git
   ```
5. Choose a local path (the folder on your machine where you'd like to store the repository)
6. Click **"Clone"** to download it

## Requirements
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Dependencies**:
  - [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)
  - [pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/)
  - [tqdm](https://pypi.org/project/tqdm/)

Install them with:
```bash
pip install requests pandas tqdm
```

Or, if you have a `requirements.txt` file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setup
### Environment Variables
Your script relies on three environment variables for Zendesk credentials:

1. **ZENDESK_SUBDOMAIN**
   * The subdomain is the part **before** `.zendesk.com`
   * **Example:** If your Zendesk URL is `https://mycompany.zendesk.com`, then `mycompany` is the subdomain

2. **ZENDESK_EMAIL**
   * The email address associated with your Zendesk account

3. **ZENDESK_API_TOKEN**
   * The API token you generate from your Zendesk admin settings

### Setting Environment Variables
* **macOS/Linux (bash/zsh):**
```bash
export ZENDESK_SUBDOMAIN="mycompany"
export ZENDESK_EMAIL="my-email@example.com"
export ZENDESK_API_TOKEN="my-api-token"
python main.py
```

* **Windows (Command Prompt):**
```bash
set ZENDESK_SUBDOMAIN=mycompany
set ZENDESK_EMAIL=my-email@example.com
set ZENDESK_API_TOKEN=my-api-token
python main.py
```

* **Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
$env:ZENDESK_SUBDOMAIN="mycompany"
$env:ZENDESK_EMAIL="my-email@example.com"
$env:ZENDESK_API_TOKEN="my-api-token"
python main.py
```

If you use a `.env` file with python-dotenv, remember to add `.env` to your `.gitignore` to prevent committing credentials.

## Usage
1. Install dependencies (see above)
2. Set your environment variables as shown
3. Run your script (for example, `python main.py`)
4. When prompted, enter the number of tickets to export or press Enter to export all

Once complete, the script will create a CSV file with the format:
```
zendesk_tickets_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv
```
This file will contain all ticket details and comments.

## Troubleshooting
* **Missing credentials**: If the script reports missing `ZENDESK_SUBDOMAIN`, `ZENDESK_EMAIL`, or `ZENDESK_API_TOKEN`, verify that you've set them correctly (see "Setting Environment Variables" above)
* **Accidental credential commit**: If you accidentally commit an API token to your repository, immediately revoke the token in Zendesk and remove it from your Git history
* **Rate limits**: Zendesk imposes rate limits; the script uses small `time.sleep` delays to avoid hitting them too quickly
* **Further help**: Refer to Zendesk's API documentation for more details on endpoints, parameters, and best practices
